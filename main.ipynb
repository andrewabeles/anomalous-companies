    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEC is an independent U.S. government agency in charge of oversight of the securities markets. Its primary goal is to protect investors, prevent fraud, and assure fair stock market trades (SEC, n.d.). All publicly traded companies are required by federal law to file quarterly (10Q) and annual (10K) reports with the SEC (Form and Content of Financial Statements, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to identify anomalies can help individual investors avoid investing in companies with higher financial risk. It can help broker-dealers invest client assets in better suited securities that carry less risk. Lastly, anomaly detection can help the SEC identify companies that might require an additional audit of their financial statements."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually retrieving and reviewing every public company's financial statements to find anomalies is a very laborious process that also requires expertise in finance and accounting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Individual Investors**  \n",
    "For individual investors without any financial acumen or data-wrangling skills, reviewing SEC-filed financial statements for anomalous companies is a very challenging task. The ability to easily identify anomalous companies would save them time and reduce their need for financial expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coporate Investors**  \n",
    "Prospective customers expect their broker or financial advisor to instantaneously identify anomalous companies and answer questions about them. Having a tool at their disposal that clusters anomalous companies would provide value to both the advisor and consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The SEC**  \n",
    "A tool for clustering companies on the basis of their submitted financials could allow agency analysts to quickly identify suspicious companies that may require closer review."

    "# Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing research on clustering financial statements for auditing and investing purposes focuses on distance, partition, hierarchical, and neural-network-based methods. One of the main challenges of this research is balancing model flexibility and interpretability. Flexibility is required to accurately capture patterns in complex multidimensional data, and to lessen the burden of prior knowledge placed on the end user. Intepretability, on the other hand, is necessary for the end user, whether it be an auditor or prospective investor, to trust the results enough to actually use them. The present study attempts to address this challenge and fill a methodological gap in the existing literature by exploring density-based clustering methods, which have been shown to perform well on other financial anomaly detection tasks (Ahmed et al., 2016). Specifically, this work uses the Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) algorithm to cluster U.S. public company financial statements and detect anomalies. OPTICS is flexible in that it can fit clusters of arbitrary shape and represent clustering information for a wide range of hyperparameter values. Furthermore, its resulting reachability plot provides intuitive cluster interpretation, especially when accompanied by a corresponding attribute plot (Ankerst et al., 1999). "

    "This project uses the density-based OPTICS algorithm to cluster and detect anomalous U.S. public company financial statements. The raw data were retrieved from the SEC's APIs and consist of the most commonly disclosed financial metrics of 2020. We explored the data for patterns and issues, which informed our preprocessing decisions. The data were normalized, imputed, and decomposed into their principal components prior to modeling. We used the following Python libraries to implement our methodology: requests, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pca, scikit-learn, and streamlit. "

    "## Data Acquisition and Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data were acquired via the SEC's Extensible Business Markup Language (XBML) APIs. These APIs contain data on thousands of distinct facts, but were were only interested in the most cmmonly reported financial ones. To identify the most prevalent metrics, we randomly sampled 100 companies from the Company Facts API (SEC, 2022a). The sample companies have collectively disclosed 5,305 unique facts, but we only retained the 46 facts reported by the majority of companies in the sample. Data on those metrics for the 2020 calendar year were then retrieved from the Frames API, though three of them had no available data (SEC, 2022b). This resulted in a dataset of 7,683 companies that disclosed at least one of the 43 facts for the 2020 calendar year. Figure 1 demonstrates the data acquisition process. Once acquired, the data were then randomly split into a training (80%) and test (20%) set. Although this work involves unsupervised learning of unlabeled data, the test set serves to ensure the methodology does not overfit to spurious clusters in the training set. "

We used 5-fold cross-validation on the training data to find the hyperparameter values that yielded the highest Silhouette coefficient.

    "Figure 10 also provides some intuition behind the clustering results by visualizing the clustering results in the first two principal components. Within this two-dimensional space, we see the majority of the normal companies are densely clustered near the origin, with most of the anomalies further spread out. However, some anomalies lie close to the origin, which suggests they are outliers in one or more of the principal components not visualized here. "

    "After identifying the anomalies, we sorted them by their reachability scores to provide a prioritized list for manual investigation. The most anomalous company was the Federal National Mortgage Association, also known as Fannie Mae. Upon inspecting its features, we found that it was an extreme outlier in the fourth principal component, which was most strongly correlated with accumulated deficit (see Figure 11). According to our raw dataset, Fannie Mae reported an accumulated deficit of $108 billion dollars at the end of 2020, so it is unsuprising that it is anomalous within that dimension. Furthermore, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) placed Fannie Mae into conservatorship in 2008 after concluding they would become insolvent (FHFA, 2022). This validates our previous interpretation of the fourth principal component as rep"
